Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJwYXNzd29yZCI6ImMzYTBhODM1LWY0OWEtNDJiNi04NzEzLWFkMTA3OTkzOWViZSJ9.x77HXBgnPgvq7aGKpLqB8Q8lcMTbjtMJhIPTQygLxjc

{
	"lang": "en",
	"limitRatio": 15,
	"max": 20,
	"text": "The Wandering Earth, described as China’s first big-budget science fiction thriller, quietly made it onto screens at AMC theaters in North America this weekend, and it shows a new side of Chinese filmmaking — one focused toward futuristic spectacles rather than China’s traditionally grand, massive historical epics. At the same time, The Wandering Earth feels like a throwback to a few familiar eras of American filmmaking. While the film’s cast, setting, and tone are all Chinese, longtime science fiction fans are going to see a lot on the screen that reminds them of other movies, for better or worse."
